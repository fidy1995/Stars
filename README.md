# Stars
This is a simple Android app made with Unity and Cardboard SDK, showing stars which is brighter than magnitude 3 or 4
(high or low res), at their real positions.

## Problems
This is a naive try, so it is clear that there's still lot of problems-it can't exit elegantly, and it takes too much 
computing and memory resources. I will try fixing them if I have enouth time.

## Purposes
This application is not just for fun.

This application aims at bringing newers for the Amateur Astronomers Association at Jincai Middle School, Shanghai, China, 
hoping to arouse other students'-especially for new Senior Ones-interest in astronomy and astrophysics. These customs at 
Jincai are well-known, but it's losing its advantages. By making this application, I will try my best to aid the association.
